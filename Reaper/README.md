# Reaper

A GPU-based parallel processing system for launching brute force attacks and other high-computation low-drag tasks. This will be used in conjunction with the titan botnet, but is its own project for smaller-scale attacks etc.

## Compiling
### Requiremenets
* CUDA enabled GPU or AMD
* OpenCL v1.2 (Newer versions are forced to this one on compile)
* A love for doing bad things

### Compiling
`mkdir build`

`cd build && cmake ..`

`make`

`Run the executable`

## Compatibility
* Linux
* OSX 

I am working on windows functionality, but it is currently untested at this time.

*Fear the reaper...*
